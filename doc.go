// Package nbid is a Name Based globally unique ID generator.
//
// NBID is generated from names using cryptographic hash function (SHA256 by default).
// The binary representation of the NBID is a 16 byte byte array.
// The string representation is using base32 hex (w/o padding) for space efficiency
// when stored in that form (26 bytes). The hex variant of base32 is used to retain the
// sortability (string and binary representation has same order).
//
// NBID doesn't use base64 because case sensitivity and the 2 non alphanum chars may be an
// issue when transported as a string between various systems. To validate a base32 NBID,
// expect a 26 chars long, all uppercase sequence of `A` to `V` letters and `0` to `9` numbers
// (`[0-9A-V]{26}`).
